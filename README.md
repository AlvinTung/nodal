System Requirements: Python 3.6.4 or Above.

To run: "python3 nodal.py"

RECOMMENDED USE: The point is to build up text in the 'output.txt' by switching between the 'Node View' and the 'Unmeaning View'. When you enter the 'Node View', random textual sources can be inserted into the editing window for you to manipulate. To manipulate simply click ‘Randomise’. ‘Group’ the interesting phrases and chains of words that will emerge by underlining it. Click ‘Randomise’ again. Again ‘Group’ the phrases and chains of words that pique your interest, or expand upon existing groups. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the finished product. When you enter the 'unmeaning view', you can insert random units of unmeaning(sentence fragments) into the editor. Switching between the views adds the results of the previous view into the 'output.txt'. Add unmeaning to 'u.txt'.
